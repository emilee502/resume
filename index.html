		<h1>Work Experience</h1>
		<p>Every Summer I work as a Conversation Pal for Compass USA for a three week homestay&#46</p>
		<p>About 120 Japanese high school students come to Spokane and stay with American host families&#46</p>
		<p>While they are here&#44 they attend English class Monday through Friday&#46</p>
		<p>The 120 students are divided into groups of 20 for these classes&#46</p>
		<p>In each class&#44 there are five American students who help the exchange students with their conversational english&#46</p>
		<p>After three years of working with this program&#44 I applied for a scholarship to go to Chiba&#44 Japan for twelve days&#46 I was awarded the scholarship and stayed with a host family while I attended a Japanese high school&#46</p>
